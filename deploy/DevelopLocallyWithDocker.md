# Develop locally with Docker

Using Docker to run your R Shiny app locally will produce a running instance of your application which mirrors Heroku 1:1. While testing your application within RStudio should work in most cases, running your application with Docker can provide additional verification for any code changes you've made.

Haven't yet installed Docker? Read [Setup your environment](deploy/SetupEnvironment.md) before continuing.
